some basic opertion we have to perform with string

-----------
name ="MUHammaD QaSiM"

(now a days we use regula expression so only defined formate get 
entered other wise
rejeted is)


name1="MUHammaD QaSiM"
name2="muhammad Qasim"

they have different address name1 and name2
print(name1==name2)
output-->False
there are two type of operation perform
in memory  or inline 
go to physical address and change value is called in memory
so if we want to change it temperorly then it is called inline 
it does not change permenantly

if you accidently change in memeory then you need to creat checks locks

operation that go into its address and change it in memeroy
operation that only temperory change it  but whenn you call it again
it will show  same previouse result 


use shift +tab in side brackets  and see

------------attributes of string datat type
after dot press tab u will get menu u will see list contain
name.methods

dir(name)   --this will give you all methods / attributes

------------
len()
name.title()
name.strip()
name.lstrip()
name.find("m")
name.lower()
it will only get first m in name string 
------
in slicing 
[start:end:step]
start index included
end index does not included
step how many step to take 
list tuple and string on all these we can use slicing
-------
a="We are pakistan we love our country!"
a.find("pakistan")
output--> 7

a[7:15:1]
ouput-->'pakistan'

-----------create dynamic  app that find paksitan and bring it-------

a[a.find("pakistan"):15]
output-->'pakistan'

-------------
a.split()  --it split them by default by space and put them in list (inline operation)
['we,'are','pakistan','we','love','our','country']


a.split('e')
['w', ' ar', ' pakistan w', ' lov', ' our country']

----------------------------------------------concatination
concatination: attaching variable with text or string
--
using %s

name='taimoor'
fater="arif"
print('my good brother %s %s ia a good boy '%(name, arif))   s--- is for string like in re.exprssion
output---> my good brother taimoor arif is a good boy 
--
using use + sign
rint('my good brother' +name+father+' ia a good boy')
output---> my good brother taimoor arif is a good boy 

##problem with + is that you cannot add integer or float variable
for that convert variable in to string type the u  text+ str(varaible) + text
score=200
print("pakistan score is " + str(score))

output--> pakistan score is 200        ---this is inline  

---
using f" text text {variable} text tex  {variable}"

print(f"my good brother{name} {father} ia a good boy")
output---> my good brother taimoor arif is a good boy 
---
"Name: {0},\n father name :{1}".formate(name,father)

output---> 
Name: taimoor
father name : arif
