------------
data type :it is object --it has class 
class it belong to has specfic methods and attributes 
and another object belong to this class get same methonds and attributes

methods :actions we can get them perform
attributes : funtion

integer,float ==numerical power

every data type has its own methods and attributes
now how to see all methods and attributes and find relevent 
methods and attributes as per need of hr

following are some of data types

>set
>tuple
>list
>dictionary 
>string

if you play with two different data type some time it will generate error
for that we raise exception

we can create our own data type
by using pre existing data types

we can create new data type using pre-existing data types
link link list we have to create but python have library which
might already have new data type created by come one and is in library
-----------
variable: variable that can be change 

like in facebook we have our name our pic and our notifications 
and facebook formate get personalize according to my  profile

variable are dynamic

so if you create a dynamic application that can change 
we put it in variable 
so some time we need static application like want to delive message to all we use static
but if you want to personalif message by adding name who is reciecing we you
dynamic and put variable 
set= no repetation
tuple = no change once created 
list = can be change like insert slice etc

in tuple,list,set we have index 
dictionary == it has no index instead it has keys :values
string 

every data type has its own functions we can perform

=-*/%** are operation
or line  run by computer 
--------------
5 + 7  this whole line is called operation
----------
(doctor also perform operation and its tool called operator)
so + sign here is operator
-------
(and patience is called oprand)
so 5  and 7 are oprand
------
when you perform complex operation  meaning using many operators

8 * 7 + 3 /2 - 4

rule we follow to solve this is PEMDAS

P=paranthesis
E=exponent
M=multiply
D=divide
A=add
S=subtract
so first  8*7 happen 
then 3/2 happen 
then there answer get added by  +
and then this answer get subtrated by -4
so 53.3

so our answer is in float and we gave input in integers
so a complex operation performed

now make it a variable make it a dynamic
let creat variable
a=7   --->this is also opertion ans it is called assign operation 
we use  = sign
(search opertors in python ---tools auzar)
we must know which tool/operator/auzar to use at what time
so
a=7
b=7
print(a)
print(b)
output
7
7

lets talk about memory managment now
so in back end some physical memeroy is being used and i has address
so when we store data in variable by using = sign
and store in memory by address 
so when you call a or b it will use it address and bring you 7

to see memeory address in python
use --->id funtion
print(id(a))
print(id(b))

in python we have two types of copy
1.shallow copy
2.deep copy

deep copy: content get copy
shallow copy:only address get copy also called copy by address

shallow copy is fast than deep copy

consider the chairs are memory address 
and on each memory address i can store one thing
and class is array
chair one is called ali
b baraber ha ali ka
so i can do that i make copy of ali and put him on new chair (classic method)

--------
so to see data type of any data type 
so to see varable data type
we have pre define funtion

type(a)
or u can also add direct value 
so it is pass by reference  or pass by referene

so this is a and it is pass by reference

print(type(a))
output--> float

similarly
c=True
d=False
print(type(c))
output-->
boolen 
boolen

d="23.0"
print(type(d))
output-->stinrg

print(type("""i love pakistan"""))
output-->string

name = ["ali","taim",20,True,False]
we call list elements  by index

from left to right indexing
          0      1    2  3    4
name = ["ali","taim",20,True,False]

form right to left indexing


name = ["ali","taim",20,True,False]
          -5    -4    -3  -2   -1
---------------
in old language or in numpy we have arry/list and it has data type same 
called homogeneious   --all data type has same memory 
hetrogeneious --- store different data type

>arry size is fix (so in numpy also we use homogeneious)



name = ["ali","taim",20,True,False]
print(type(name))
ouptput--list

using () will make it tuple-- and back end opeation change
tuple= ("ali","taim",20,True,False)
indexing also apply to this
benefit of index

print(name[4]) 
to call by index give variable with square brackect and init index 
varaible[index]

so if you want to be good in programming you should be able to interpreter as programming 
language will interpret like you know already what python will do this
so bugges and error alos get find by looking each line and interpreting it
---------------------------------------
another data type we have is 
set
name = {"ali","taim","ali","zain"}
print(name)
output = "ali","taim","zain"

this is set and as ali is more then one time so it will only print it one time no repeating
 
***set is use to give unique values
so order does not matter  
so that s why every time you print it will give you values in different 
order  but no repeted value 
so it is good to get 
--------------
how to change one data type to other type 

name is set 
so lets change it in to list

name=list(name) 
list() funtions will change is temprorly so we have to assign it to variable
so we assign it to same varaible name
now name is not set but list
type


*in list tuple index no if impotant and fixed
------------
dictionray 
why we need dictionary 
when ever i add value 
to name,father name,age
some one will say father name or age first

so we need dictionary 
we are replacing index number with key so we can name key and by 
providing key only then you can assign value in dictionray
so we always have to pass key : then value
this way in father key only father name will get 
in age key only age value will get entered

always use name of variable as per what it is for don't use nmae that 
after month you see your program you cannot interpret it 

>mutable:
>immutable:

key----hash funtion:
what is hashable and inhashable:
--
any data type whom hash function can be applied can be made key in dictionary
we can use key: stinrg,integer


data ={"name":"taim",
       "father:"arif",
       "age":27,
      }

so instead using index to call "taim"
we now use key 
dictionary has no index

print(data["name"])
output--> taim
varaibale[key]
